Where did my repos go?
======================

If you are looking for one of my public repositories and you can't find it, then this page is for you.
Recently, I've become unsatisfied with GitHub services, so I am moving all my public repos to GitLab.
You can find my public repos in the [CS MSU Course Tasks](https://gitlab.com/ruro-courses) group on GitLab.
Most repositories also changed their names, so here is a list with links to all the transferred repositories.
